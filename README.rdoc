Here we are!

I'm using this rails app to host a bunch of random things I feel like doing.
So far, it's a really crappy implementation of minesweeper and a scattergories sorta thing

Currently hosted on http://arcane-savannah-2549.herokuapp.com/
(but please for the love of all that is good and nice in the world, don't play minesweeper)

(scattergories would be fun though)
